2. Own bag file:- 
  	1. Topic:- 
  		1. /scan
  		2. /tf
  		3. /odom
  		4. /imu
  		5. /points

  	2. I have tried various combinations of above topic and node starts running information without any error, but when as soon I subscribe to `/map` topic, the node throws an error without giving much infromation. 
  	Error is:-
  	exit code -11, cmd /home/cair/softw
	ares/cartographer_ws/install_isolated/lib/cartographer_ros/cartographer_occupancy_grid_node -resoluti
	on 0.05 __name:=cartographer_occupancy_grid_node

	3. These are my launch file and lua scripts.

3.	1. What are the things I might be doing wrong?
	
	2. Could there be possibility that my installation might be erroneous(How could I check that, since I am to do all the steps without any error in installation proces?)

	3. Or my launch files or configurations are wrong?
